**Requirements Document: Virtual USB Keyboard Application for Android Tablet**

---

### **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to create an Android application that transforms an Android tablet into a virtual USB keyboard. When connected to a Windows PC via USB, the tablet should emulate a standard USB keyboard using the USB HID protocol. This app will allow the user to input text or commands on the Android tablet, and the input will be transmitted to the connected PC as keyboard keystrokes.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **USB HID Keyboard Emulation**
   - The application must emulate a USB HID (Human Interface Device) keyboard.
   - It must use the USB HID descriptor for a standard keyboard.

2. **Keypress Simulation**
   - The application must allow the user to input alphanumeric characters, special keys (e.g., Enter, Backspace), and modifiers (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt).
   - The app should translate these inputs into USB HID-compliant keypress reports and send them to the connected PC.

3. **User Interface (UI)**
   - A virtual keyboard UI must be presented on the Android tablet.
   - The keyboard should include:
     - Alphanumeric keys (A-Z, 0-9).
     - Common special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`, `!`, etc.).
     - Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock).
     - Special keys (Enter, Backspace, Space, Tab).
   - Keys must be interactive and send corresponding keypress events to the PC.

4. **USB Connection Handling**
   - The app must detect when a USB connection to a Windows PC is established.
   - Upon connection, the app must configure itself as a USB HID device.
   - Handle USB permissions dynamically using Android’s `UsbManager`.

5. **HID Descriptor**
   - The app must define a standard USB HID keyboard descriptor.
   - The descriptor must support:
     - Modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt, Shift).
     - Up to 6 simultaneous keypresses (as per the HID specification).

6. **Keypress and Key Release**
   - The app must send HID reports for keypress and key release events.
   - The HID report format should conform to USB HID standards.

7. **Platform Compatibility**
   - The application must be compatible with Android 7.0 (Nougat) and above.
   - The target PC must recognize the app as a USB keyboard on Windows 10 and later.

### **Technical Requirements**

1. **USB Communication**
   - The app must use Android’s USB Host API to establish communication with the PC.
   - Use `UsbManager`, `UsbDevice`, and `UsbDeviceConnection` to interact with the connected USB host.

2. **HID Report Format**
   - Use the following HID report format:
     - Byte 1: Modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt, Shift).
     - Byte 2: Reserved (always 0).
     - Bytes 3-8: Keycodes for up to 6 simultaneous keys.
   - Example HID report for the ‘A’ key:
     ```
     [0x00, 0x00, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]
     ```

3. **USB HID Descriptor**
   - The app must include a keyboard descriptor with:
     - Usage Page: Generic Desktop (0x01).
     - Usage: Keyboard (0x06).
     - Collection: Application.
     - Logical Min/Max: 0/1 for modifiers, 0/255 for keys.

4. **USB Permission Handling**
   - Request USB permissions dynamically using `PendingIntent` and handle `UsbManager.ACTION_USB_PERMISSION` intent.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Handle cases where the PC does not recognize the device as a keyboard.
   - Provide clear error messages if USB permissions are denied.

6. **Performance**
   - Ensure low latency for keypress transmission to the PC.
   - Optimize power consumption to avoid excessive battery drain.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Security**
   - The app must only communicate with authorized USB devices.

2. **Usability**
   - The UI should be intuitive, allowing users to type easily without prior training.

3. **Maintainability**
   - The codebase should be modular, with separate components for USB handling, HID report generation, and UI rendering.

4. **Extensibility**
   - Future updates should allow additional input modes, such as mouse emulation or gamepad input.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The app is detected as a USB keyboard when connected to a Windows PC.
2. The user can type text and press special keys using the virtual keyboard on the tablet.
3. The PC accurately receives and processes all keypresses and releases.
4. USB permission handling works seamlessly, with appropriate feedback for the user.
5. The app works on Android 7.0+ and Windows 10+ without compatibility issues.

### **Deliverables**

1. Fully functional Android app package (APK).
2. Source code with documentation.
3. Instructions for setting up the development environment and deploying the app.
4. Test report demonstrating the app’s functionality and compatibility.
